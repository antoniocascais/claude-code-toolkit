# Planner Skill

Task capture and organization system with typed folders, inbox triage, and weekly planning.

## Storage Location

**Base Directory**: `/path/to/claude/tasks_notes/`

```
tasks_notes/
├── _inbox/              # Quick capture (classify later)
├── work/                # Job deliverables, meetings
├── learning/            # Skills, courses, experiments
├── product/             # Personal app builds
├── content/             # Blog posts, tweets, demos
├── career/              # Job search, networking, interview prep
└── admin/               # Life stuff, errands, misc
```

Folders are auto-created on first use.

## Commands

### `/planner help`
Show available commands and usage.

### `/planner add "<task>" [--type TYPE] [--priority PRIORITY]`
Add a task to a typed folder.
- `--type`: work, learning, product, content, career, admin (auto-detected if omitted)
- `--priority`: high, medium, low (default: medium)

Examples:
```
/planner add "Fix prod auth bug" --type work --priority high
/planner add "RAG tutorial" --type learning
/planner add "Update LinkedIn" --type career
```

Creates either:
- Entry in `TYPE/tasks.md` (simple tasks)
- Individual file `TYPE/<task-name>.md` (complex tasks)

### `/planner inbox "<task>"`
Quick capture to inbox for later classification.

```
/planner inbox "random idea for newsletter"
```

### `/planner classify`
Review inbox items and move to correct folders.

**Confirmation required:** For each item:
1. Show the task
2. Suggest type based on keyword matching (see `reference/taxonomy.md`)
3. Ask user: "Move to [type]? (y/n/other)"
4. Only move after explicit confirmation
5. If user says "other", prompt for correct type

### `/planner week`
Generate weekly plan from active tasks.
- Reads all typed folders
- Creates `week-plan-YYYY-MM-DD.md` in base directory
- Groups tasks by type with focus areas

### `/planner review`
Show task status overview.
- Task counts per folder
- In-progress items highlighted
- Inbox items needing classification

## Workflows

### Quick Capture Flow
1. User: `/planner inbox "some idea"`
2. Skill creates `_inbox/some-idea.md` or adds to `_inbox/tasks.md`
3. Later: `/planner classify` to sort

### Focused Add Flow
1. User: `/planner add "task" --type work --priority high`
2. Skill detects complexity (simple → tasks.md, complex → individual file)
3. Creates entry with status: pending, priority: high

### Weekly Planning Flow
1. User: `/planner week`
2. Skill scans all folders for pending/in_progress tasks
3. Generates week plan with focus areas
4. User reviews and adjusts priorities

## Task Types

See `reference/taxonomy.md` for detailed type definitions and routing rules.

| Type | Folder | Triggers |
|------|--------|----------|
| work | `work/` | job, meeting, deliverable, sprint, PR, deploy |
| learning | `learning/` | learn, course, study, practice, tutorial, read |
| product | `product/` | build, app, feature, ship, MVP, side project |
| content | `content/` | blog, post, tweet, demo, video, write |
| career | `career/` | job, interview, resume, network, LinkedIn |
| admin | `admin/` | errand, pay, schedule, misc, appointment |

## Templates

### Simple Tasks (per-folder list)
See `templates/tasks.md`

### Complex Task (individual file)
See `templates/task-detail.md`

### Week Plan
See `templates/week-plan.md`

## Task Complexity Heuristic

**Simple** (add to tasks.md):
- One-liner description
- No sub-tasks needed
- Estimated < 1 hour

**Complex** (create individual file):
- Needs breakdown or notes
- Multiple steps or dependencies
- User explicitly requests file

When uncertain, ask user preference.

## Operations

### Auto-Create Folders
Before any write operation, check if target folder exists. If not, create folder and initialize `tasks.md` from template.

### Status Values
- `pending` - Not started
- `in_progress` - Currently working
- `done` - Completed
- `blocked` - Waiting on something

### Priority Values
- `high` - Do this week
- `medium` - Do this month
- `low` - Backlog
