Use **fuzzy matching** to resolve $ARGUMENTS to a folder under:
1) `/path/to/claude/tasks_notes/` (active projects only)
2) `/path/to/claude/knowledge_base/`

### Matching rules
- Normalize: lowercase; trim; spaces/underscores → hyphens; strip trailing punctuation.
- **Prefer active over archived**: Prioritize `tasks_notes/` active folders over `tasks_notes/archived/`
- Prefer `tasks_notes/` over `knowledge_base/` if both match.
- **Skip archived by default**: Exclude `tasks_notes/archived/` unless explicitly requested
- Consider **path contains / starts-with** matches (hyphen/underscore-insensitive).
- Consider **content matches**: any `*.md` whose content matches the query words.
- If multiple plausible matches exist, show a **ranked list** and choose the best; if uncertain, ask.

### Load & summarize
- **List** all files in matched folder (ignore `.git/`, `node_modules/`, build artifacts).
- **Read only** `notes.md` as the entry point.
- Trust `notes.md` references other files via `[[links]]` or path mentions.
- Summarize: purpose/context, active tasks, recent updates, blockers, next actions.
- End with `Loaded from: <path>` and a 3–5 bullet "Now up to speed" summary.

### If no notes.md
- Report "no notes.md found in <folder>".
- List available `.md` files in the folder.

### If nothing suitable
- Say no strong match found; list top candidates from both roots and propose likely intents.

> Hint: If available, use `ag` to quickly find both path-based and content-based candidates.
